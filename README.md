for changelog and build instructions

Prebuilt binary for plane: Released/FW & Char/MinimOSD_Extra_Plane_R8??.hex

For this to work well (it can still work ok-ish without), it's better to set SR1_RC_CHAN 5 
(although it can work with the default of 2, it's just more picky about timing). 
If your OSD board is plugged into serial2 instead of serial2, then change SR2 instead.
